# navier-stokes-2d
A simple real-time 2D fluid simulation based on Navier-Stokes Equations.

This project is suggested by course [*Introduction to Computer Graphics*](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html) as one of its course final project topics. The general implementation ideas come from paper [*Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games*](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf).
